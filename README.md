# Algorithm-Efficiency-Test
A small experiment I did with python to test different types of algorithm's effieciency. Algorithm efficiency plays a vital role in any program specially when dealing with Big Data.


Most common Big Data applications:
- `Goverment`: 
Proccess efficiencies in terms of cost, productivity, and innovation without its flaws.
- `Inernational development`:
Research on the effective usage of information and communication technologies for development 
- `Healthcare`:
Track infected people to minimise spread.
- `Education`
- `Media`
- `Incurance`

    ...

    and lots more

## ‚ö° Features

-   Allows the user to choose 3 different algorithms with different efficiecies.
- Displays the execution time for each run.

## üíª Supported operations
-   `stacks`: calculates the total number of prime numbers of a set using a single loop and a stack data structure.

    Time complexity: O(n)

    (most efficient)

<br>

- `nested loops`: calcualtes the total prime numbers using nested loops.

    Time complexity: O(n)^2

    (less efficient but more accurate)

<br>

- `recursion`: calculates the total prime numbers of a set by itrating throught the came function while incrementing the number each time.

    (Least efficient)

[Note: python supports a limited number of recursive calls, so large numbers do not always work]

Recursion is least efficient since the function has to add to the stack memory with each recursive call and keep the values there until the call is finished, the memory allocation is greater than that of an iterative function.

## üîß Installation

1. Install newest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Run program
